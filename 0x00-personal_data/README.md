## 0x00. Personal data

## Requirements
* Language: Javascript, Python 3.8.5 (and C )
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: python3  (and gcc 9.3.0)
* Version: MySQL  8.0.25
* Style guidelines: [Pycodestyle] (https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle)


## Synopsis
This repository holds some python projects I worked on at ALX SPECIALIZATION.

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* How to implement a log filter that will obfuscate PII fields
* How to encrypt a password and check the validity of an input password
* How to authenticate to a database using environment variables

# Requirements
##General
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* All your functions should be type annotated


## Tasks

* 0. Regex-ing
* 1. Log formatter
* 2. Create logger
* 3. Connect to secure database
* 4. Read and filter data
* 5. Encrypting passwords
* 6. Check valid password
* 7. Infer appropriate time zone
